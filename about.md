# About Grant Hustle

## Our Story

<!-- TODO: Add full about story -->

Grant Hustle was born from a personal loss and a commitment to make a difference. When my uncle passed away, I saw firsthand how many brilliant ideas, passionate projects, and life-changing initiatives never come to fruition simply because of lack of funding.

This realization sparked a mission: to democratize access to grants and make funding opportunities accessible to everyone, from individual artists and solopreneurs to established nonprofits and research institutions.

## What We Do

We've built **Grant Geenie**, an intelligent grant search and matching platform that:

- Aggregates federal, state, and private grant opportunities
- Provides smart filtering by location, category, and eligibility
- Sends deadline alerts so you never miss an opportunity
- Offers resources and guidance for grant applications

## Our Team

<!-- TODO: Add team member information -->

We're a dedicated team of technologists, grant writers, and advocates who believe that funding shouldn't be a barrier to impact.
