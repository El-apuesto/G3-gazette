# Our Mission

## Democratizing Access to Funding

<!-- TODO: Expand mission statement -->

At Grant Hustle, our mission is simple yet profound: **Make grant funding accessible to everyone who needs it.**

### Our Core Values

**Accessibility**
We believe that finding grants shouldn't require expensive consultants or insider knowledge. Our platform is designed to be intuitive and accessible to everyone.

**Transparency**
We provide clear, honest information about grant opportunities, eligibility requirements, and application processes.

**Empowerment**
We don't just list grants - we provide the tools, resources, and knowledge you need to successfully apply and secure funding.

**Community**
We're building a community of grant seekers who support and learn from each other.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where every worthy project has access to the funding it needs to succeed. Where artists can create without financial stress. Where nonprofits can focus on their mission instead of endless fundraising. Where entrepreneurs can innovate without the burden of capital constraints.
